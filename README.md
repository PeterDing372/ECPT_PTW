#### Clone the repository

Once you have created a repository from this template and the `Template cleanup` workflow has completed, you can click the green button to get a link for cloning your repository.
Note that it is easiest to push to a repository if you set up SSH with Github, please see the [related documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). SSH is required for pushing to a Github repository when using two-factor authentication.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PeterDing372/ECPT_PTW.git
cd ECPT_PTW
```

#### Set project organization and name in build.sbt


To run the included test with:
```sh
sbt test
```

```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
